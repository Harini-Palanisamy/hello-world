# hello-world
creating my first repository
I am really new to the github, so i am referring to the guide page to get started up. Hope i will learn better and master one day.
OKAY, till now I did according to the tutorail, so now i need to work for myself.
So yeah, I am now creating another branch to copy the contents of the master branch.
So later i will merge this another-try into master branch using pull request.
